# Changelog

All notable changes to ResForge are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **The custom JSON reader now enforces RFC 8259 syntax.** Leading plus signs,
  leading-zero integers, malformed fractions/exponents, unescaped controls, and
  lone Unicode surrogates are rejected; valid surrogate pairs remain supported.
- **Fetch history can no longer block a valid download from opening.** Downloaded
  bytes are validated as a resource before history is recorded, and serialized
  history is bounded to the Preferences value limit; history persistence failure
  occurs only after the valid document is already open.
- **glTF node transforms now apply correctly to imported morph shapes.** Morph
  position deltas receive the mesh node's accumulated rotation and scale, but not
  translation, before conversion back to Haven coordinates.
- **Repeated image edits no longer retain obsolete layer payloads indefinitely.**
  The layer-table thumbnail cache now stores only thumbnail-capable layers, uses a
  256-entry LRU bound, and evicts replaced/deleted or non-restored undo/redo layers.
- **Failed Save As attempts no longer change the active file path.** ResForge now
  updates the window title/path and clears dirty state only after serialization
  and atomic persistence succeed; write failures leave the current document and
  destination unchanged.
- **glTF export no longer assigns unrelated textures to unmapped materials.**
  Materials without an explicit local `matid → mat2 → tex` mapping—including
  `matid=-1` and external-only materials—now omit `baseColorTexture` instead of
  inheriting the first embedded texture.
- **Rejected text/JSON replacements no longer report success.** The GUI apply
  path now returns whether a mutation was committed, so malformed JSON,
  unsupported codec values, and out-of-range numbers leave payload, dirty/undo
  state, and status consistent instead of displaying a false “Updated” message.
- **Quantized BoneOff rotation edits no longer wrap modulo one turn.**
  `angleTurns` now rejects non-finite values and values outside the representable
  `0` through `65535/65536` range instead of masking values such as `1.5` into
  an unrelated `0.5`-turn rotation.
- **Malformed UTF-8 text layers can no longer be silently rewritten.** The
  `tooltip`/`pagina` editor now requires strict UTF-8 decoding and byte-identical
  re-encoding. Invalid payloads stay raw and expose only Replace/Export actions
  instead of displaying replacement characters that would change bytes on Apply.
- **Late GUI workers can no longer overwrite a newer document or edit.** Open,
  fetch, and glTF rebuild operations now capture the active document identity,
  revision, and operation generation; stale completions are discarded. Rebuild
  also shows an application-modal progress dialog, preventing conflicting user
  actions while geometry is regenerated.
- **Resource downloads now have a 64 MiB response limit.** Fetching uses a
  bounded streaming subscriber: an excessive `Content-Length` is rejected before
  body allocation, and chunked/unknown-length responses are cancelled as soon as
  they cross the same limit instead of growing until the JVM runs out of memory.
- **Deeply nested typed-object data no longer crashes layer parsing.** The
  `rlink`, `codeentry`, and `mat2` readers now cap nested `tto` lists/maps at
  256 levels. Crafted resources that previously escaped malformed-layer handling
  with a `StackOverflowError` are now rejected through each parser's normal
  failure path.
- **HiDPI/fractional-scaling: the GUI no longer renders too small.** On a monitor
  using fractional Windows display scaling (e.g. a 4K screen at 150%), the Windows
  Look&Feel handed back its core control fonts (`Label`, `Button`, `TextField`,
  `Table`, `List`, …) at roughly the 96-dpi point size *divided* by the scale
  factor — Tahoma 7 instead of ~12 — while menu fonts stayed correct. Since Java
  already applies the display's render transform to everything, those mis-sized
  fonts came out ~1/scale too small and the whole editor looked tiny, even though
  the layout scaled fine. ResForge now normalises the Look&Feel's default fonts
  after selecting it, lifting any that are too small up to a trusted reference size
  while preserving each font's family and style. The correct *logical* size is
  DPI-independent (the transform handles pixel density), so this is a no-op on a
  100%-scaled display and fixes 125%/150%/200% (`gui/UiScaling`).

### Added

- **Dark mode.** A new **Options → Dark mode** toggle switches the whole editor
  between a light and a dark theme, applied live (no restart) and remembered
  between launches. The GUI now uses the [FlatLaf](https://www.formdev.com/flatlaf/)
  Look&Feel to provide both themes; the transparency checkerboard and placeholder
  text behind image/animation previews adapt to the active theme, and muted hint
  labels re-tint on a live switch (`gui/Theme`).

- **Modern Windows file dialog with an address bar (paste a folder/file path).**
  On Windows, the **Open** and **Save as** pickers now use the modern Explorer
  "Common Item Dialog" instead of the legacy Win32 one, so you get the editable
  breadcrumb **address bar** — paste a full folder or file path straight into the
  top bar rather than clicking through folders. Implemented by driving the COM
  `IFileOpenDialog`/`IFileSaveDialog` interfaces via JNA
  (new `gui/WinFileDialogs`), run on a dedicated STA thread and made modal to the
  editor window. It degrades gracefully: on any failure — and on every non-Windows
  platform — it falls back to the previous `java.awt.FileDialog`, so nothing can
  crash or regress. Adds **JNA** (`jna` + `jna-platform`, dual-licensed
  LGPL-2.1+/Apache-2.0) as a bundled dependency, folded into the fat jar like
  JOrbis; see [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md).
- **Optional manual UI-scale override — now settable in the GUI.** Choose
  **Options → UI scale…** to pick a scale factor (0.5–4.0; 1.0 = the automatic
  default) that makes the editor uniformly larger or smaller — not just the fonts,
  but the layout too (table row height and thumbnails, panel/preview sizes, the
  window, spinners, paddings), so everything stays proportional at any factor. It's
  saved to your preferences and applied on the next launch (the app tells you a
  restart is needed). For scripted/one-off use the same override is still available
  at launch via `RESFORGE_UI_SCALE` (environment variable) or `-Dresforge.uiScale`
  (JVM property); a launch override takes precedence over the saved GUI preference.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-28

### Added

- **`props` layers now expose far more `tto` value types as editable JSON.** The
  `props` codec adopts the same explicit tagged-value JSON form as `mat2`: a string
  stays a plain JSON string, and every other value is a single-key object naming its
  exact `tto` type — `{"u8":50}`, `{"f32":0.5}`, `{"color":[204,204,204,255]}`,
  `{"coord":[x,y]}`, `{"bytes":"<base64>"}`, `{"list":[…]}`, `{"map":{…}}`. It now
  models coord, color, fcolor, fcoord32/fcoord64, byte blobs (base64), float32, uid,
  resid and resource specs in addition to the JSON-native types, so props that used to
  fall back to raw are now editable (validated on `belltower`'s `use-point` `fcoord64`).
  The lossless-or-raw guard is unchanged, and a handful of types still kept raw on
  purpose (float8/float16 and the snorm/unorm/mnorm numbers, whose round-trip isn't
  provably byte-exact).
- **Resolve external static textures in the 3D viewer.** A **Resolve external textures
  (network)** toggle in the **View 3D** window textures parts whose base comes from an
  *external static material* — an `mlink`/external `tex` string naming **one fixed
  resource** (e.g. a tree's bark, which lives in a separate `…-tex` resource). It fetches
  that resource and follows its own `matid→mat2→tex` chain (`model/ExternalTextures`:
  injectable fetcher, per-path cache, depth cap + cycle guard). Off by default, since the
  viewer is otherwise fully offline, and **shown only when the model actually has external
  static materials** (detected offline via `ExternalTextures.hasExternalStatic`, no fetch);
  resolved parts are textured but not added to the per-material picker (the linked palette
  isn't theirs to swap). Runtime *variable materials* (wood-type swaps) and `Dyntex` `spr` sprite additions are out of scope and
  stay shaded — their final image isn't stored in the model `.res`. Validated end-to-end on
  the mulberry tree (bark + berries texture once resolved).
- **Per-material texture picker in the 3D viewer.** The **View 3D** window now shows a
  dropdown for each *locally-textured* material (split across two balanced rows when a
  model has several), listing the resource's own `tex` layers (by id), so you can choose
  which texture a part is drawn with — e.g. flip a tree's leaves between their seasonal
  variants live (mulberry carries four). The full local-texture palette is offered,
  including variants no mesh uses by default. A material whose base is variable/external
  (a `varmat` declared in `code`, an `mlink` to another resource, or only a local `otex`
  overlay) gets no dropdown — the local palette isn't its to swap — so a model like knarr
  shows one picker (its one locally-textured part) rather than ten.

### Changed

- **The `props` `.json` shape is now explicitly tagged.** Values that previously
  appeared bare (an integer `50`, a list `[…]`, a nested map) are now single-key
  tagged objects (`{"u8":50}`, `{"list":[…]}`, `{"map":{…}}`), so the exact `tto`
  width/type is recorded and a JSON object is unambiguously a tag (matching `mat2`).
  Re-unpack any props `.resdir` that was unpacked with an older build before repacking.
- **The "Fetch from server" dialog now focuses the Resource path field on open.**
  Opening the dialog (toolbar **Fetch from Server**, **File ▸ Fetch from server**, or
  **Ctrl+R**) puts the keyboard cursor straight in the *Resource path* box, so you can
  type a path immediately without first clicking the field.

### Fixed

- **Local 3D texture lookup resolved by id, not position.** A material's
  `tex`/`otex` command selects its texture by the `tex` layer's **id** (the game's
  `flayer(TexR.class, id)` lookup), but the **View 3D** viewer and the **glTF export**
  were treating that value as a positional index into the resource's `tex` layers.
  Models whose `tex` ids aren't `0,1,2,…` in order rendered/exported with the wrong
  texture — e.g. the mulberry tree (`tex` ids `1,3,4,5`, four seasonal leaf variants)
  showed its leaves with the wrong foliage variant. Both paths now map the id to the
  matching `tex` layer. (Parts whose texture lives in *another* resource — e.g. the
  mulberry trunk via `mlink` — remain shaded, as documented.)

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-24

First stable release. ResForge decompiles, edits, and recompiles Haven & Hearth
`.res` files — as a Swing GUI and a scriptable CLI — with a **lossless-by-construction**
guarantee: unchanged layers are preserved byte-for-byte, and a typed editor is only
offered for a layer when its decode→edit→encode round-trip is proven byte-exact
("lossless-or-raw"). Validated against a real ~8.8k-file corpus (`verify`: all pass).

### Editing

- **2D images** (`image`) — swap the embedded PNG/JPEG (any size; length recomputed)
  and edit the header (id, z/sub-z, draw offset, no-offset flag); new image layers are
  wrapped in a fresh header with the next free id.
- **3D model textures** (`tex`) — swap the texture (JPEG/PNG) and its separate **alpha
  mask**, and edit the `tex` header (id, atlas offset, declared size).
- **Sounds** (`audio2`) — swap the Ogg Vorbis clip and edit its id + volume; the GUI
  plays it (play/stop/draggable seek).
- **Fonts** (`font`) and **MIDI** (`midi`) — swap the embedded typeface / music file.
- **Terrain tiles** (`tile`) — swap a ground/transition tile image.
- **Typed JSON editors** (lossless-or-raw): `props`, `action`, `mat2`, `anim`
  (sprite animation: speed + frames), `neg` (click hotspot + connection points),
  `obst` (movement-collision polygons), `boneoff` (equip-point opcode program),
  and `light` (light source: colours, attenuation, direction).
- **Text** (`tooltip`, `pagina`) — edit as UTF-8.
- **3D models** (`vbuf2`/`mesh` + `skel`/`skan`/`manim`) — a full **glTF round-trip**
  through Blender: **Export to glTF** writes a self-contained `.glb` (geometry, both
  UV sets, embedded textures, skeleton + skinning, skeletal and mesh-morph animations);
  **Rebuild from glTF** regenerates geometry so you can reshape/sculpt, re-UV, add,
  remove or re-topologize vertices/faces and whole parts (positions/normals/UVs/weights
  re-quantised into the original on-wire formats, tangents recomputed, skeleton re-posed,
  morph shapes re-shaped). Multi-part, skinned, morph-animated and normal-mapped models
  are supported. Not byte-lossless — verify rebuilt models in-game.

### Viewing & inspection

- **Built-in 3D viewer** (**View 3D**) — a dependency-free pure-Java software renderer:
  z-buffered rasteriser, two-sided Lambert shading, perspective-correct texturing with
  alpha-mask cutout, optional wireframe, mouse orbit/zoom/pan, in the model's bind pose.
- **Live sprite-animation preview** — `anim` frames resolved to sibling image layers and
  composited at their true relative size and per-frame offset.
- **Read-only views** for `code`/`codeentry` (class names + classpath manifest; `.class`
  export), the rig layers `skel`/`skan`/`manim`, and the dependency/reference layers
  `deps`/`rlink`/`src` (`src` exports as `.java`).
- **References report** (toolbar **References…** / CLI `refs`) — one deduplicated list of
  every resource a file references, aggregated across `deps`, `rlink` (all link types),
  `tileset2`/`flavobj`, `code` classpaths and `mat2` material links.

### Fetching

- **Fetch from server…** — download a resource straight from the game's resource server
  by its in-game path; successful paths are remembered as substring-matched, click-to-use
  suggestions.
- **Open from game cache…** — scan the local Haven cache for the resource *names* you
  already have, then fetch the chosen one **fresh from the server** (so you always open
  the latest version; cached bytes are never opened directly).

### Command-line interface

Every operation is scriptable: `gui`, `info`, `catalog`, `refs`, `fetch`,
`cache-list`, `replace`, `unpack`/`pack`, `gltf`, `rebuild-gltf`, and `verify`.

### Reliability & safety

- **Lossless-or-raw** typed editing — never expose a typed editor unless decode→encode
  is byte-exact; untouched layers always pass through unchanged.
- **Atomic writes** — all `.res`/`.glb` output goes through a temp file + atomic rename,
  so an interrupted/full-disk save can't truncate your only copy.
- **Hostile-input hardening** — overflow-safe reader bounds, layer-length validation,
  strict UTF-8, recursion-depth caps, range-checked typed edits, and validated glTF
  input, so a crafted or truncated file fails cleanly rather than hanging, OOM-ing, or
  corrupting output.
- **~190 JUnit 5 tests** and a batch round-trip oracle (`verify`); three equivalent
  builds (Gradle, Maven, Ant) producing the same runnable fat jar.

### Known limitations

See [README → Status / scope → Known limitations](README.md#known-limitations-10).
In short: animation **keyframe** editing (`skan` timing, adding/removing `manim` frames)
is read-only; `code`/`codeentry` are read-only; the glTF rebuild is not byte-lossless
(verify in-game); the 3D viewer shows `varmat`-textured parts shaded; and a few unusual
typed instances stay raw by design (lossless-or-raw).
