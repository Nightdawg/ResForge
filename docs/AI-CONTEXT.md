# AI-CONTEXT — start here

A dense, single-file primer so a fresh session (human or AI) can resume work on
`ResForge` quickly. For the deep reverse-engineering log and format details
see [`DESIGN-notes.md`](DESIGN-notes.md); for source provenance see
[`reference/README.md`](reference/README.md). Update this file when the
architecture, feature set, or "next steps" materially change.

> Quick lookups: a tiny local retriever lives in [`../kb/`](../kb/README.md) —
> `java kb/Rag.java "your question"` runs BM25 over `kb/notes/` + `docs/` + the
> Java source (no build, no deps). Add `-f` to print whole chunks (best for AI:
> full grounded context in one call), e.g.
> `java kb/Rag.java -f "how does the tex codec recompute length"`. Append new

## 1. What this is
A standalone **Java 21** tool to decompile, edit, and recompile Haven & Hearth
`.res` resource files for modding — both a **CLI** and a **Swing GUI**. Core
guarantee: **lossless by construction** — unchanged layers are preserved
byte-for-byte; typed editors are only offered when they re-encode exactly
("lossless-or-raw"). Reverse-engineered from the game client (`hafen-client`,
a sibling project at `../hafen-client`).

## 2. Build & run (IMPORTANT gotchas)
- **JAVA_HOME must point at the JDK *root*** (the folder that *contains* `bin`),
  **not** the `\bin` sub-directory — Gradle and Maven reject a `\bin` JAVA_HOME.
  This is a common mistake; any vendor's JDK 21 root works.
- **Three equivalent builds, separate output dirs (all gitignored):**
  - Gradle → `build-gradle/`: `./gradlew build` (compile+test), `./gradlew jar`.
  - Maven → `build-maven/`: `mvn package` (compile+test+jar); output redirected
    from the usual `target/` via `<build><directory>`. Fat jar via shade plugin;
    jorbis + JUnit fetched from Maven Central.
  - Ant → `build-ant/`: `ant` or `ant jar` (no tests, default target), `ant build`
    (jar+tests), `ant gui` (launch GUI detached), `ant test`, `ant clean`.
    JUnit jars are vendored in `lib/`; Ant needs 1.10+ (native `junitlauncher`).
- **Runnable jar:** `build-gradle/libs/` or `build-ant/libs/` or `build-maven/`,
  all `resforge-1.1.0.jar`. Use the jar (not `gradlew/ant run`) for paths with
  spaces — `--args`/`-Dargs` mangle them.
- **Runtime dependency components (three; four jars):** `org.jcraft:jorbis` 0.0.17
  (LGPL-2.0-or-later, ~97 KB, bundles `jogg`+`jorbis`) — the GUI's Ogg player; **JNA**
  `net.java.dev.jna:jna` +
  `:jna-platform` 5.15.0 (dual LGPL-2.1+/Apache-2.0) — Windows-only, drives the modern
  Explorer file dialog (`gui/WinFileDialogs`), with a `FileDialog` fallback elsewhere;
  and **FlatLaf** `com.formdev:flatlaf` 3.7.2 (Apache-2.0) — Swing light/dark themes.
  JOrbis is vendored for Gradle/Ant and pulled from Central by Maven; JNA and FlatLaf
  are pulled from Central by Gradle/Maven and vendored for Ant. All are folded into
  the jar (Gradle fat-jar via runtimeClasspath; Ant merged runtime staging; Maven
  Shade). All three omit dependency root `module-info.class` and Maven-only
  project metadata, yielding one canonical fat-JAR entry-name set. The CLI never uses
  either.
- **License:** project is **MIT** (`LICENSE`, Copyright Nightdawg). Bundled JOrbis
  stays **LGPL-2.0-or-later**, bundled JNA stays **LGPL-2.1+/Apache-2.0**, FlatLaf stays
  **Apache-2.0**, and the
  `docs/reference/*.java` client files stay **LGPL-3** — all documented in
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`; fat JARs carry canonical copies under
  `META-INF/licenses/` (keep those notices on redistribution).
  Only the core JOrbis decoder is used, never the GPL JOrbisPlayer.
- Verifying the GUI: launch the jar, screenshot the screen, view the PNG. GUI
  mouse/keys automation is flaky — prefer screenshotting + trusting shared code
  paths. Always `Stop-Process -Id <PID>` test windows (never kill IntelliJ).

## 3. CLI commands (`resforge.Main`)
`gui [file]` · `fetch <path> [out.res]` · `info <file>` · `refs <file>` ·
`unpack <file> [dir]` · `pack <dir> [out]` · `replace <file> <selector> <newfile> [out]` ·
`gltf <file> [out.glb]` ·
`rebuild-gltf <orig.res> <edited.glb> [out.res]` ·
`catalog <file|dir>` · `cache-list [cacheDir]` · `verify <file|dir>`.
No args (with a display) → launches the GUI. (`refs` lists every resource a
`.res` references, aggregated across `deps`/`rlink`/`codeentry`/`mat2`. `gltf`
exports the 3D model as a Blender-ready binary glTF, and `rebuild-gltf`
regenerates geometry from an edited `.glb` to allow reshaped/added/removed vertices.
`cache-list` scans the local game cache and prints the resource names found there,
ready to `fetch`.)
`replace` selector: layer name (`image`), name+occurrence (`tex#2`), or index (`#5`).

## 4. GUI (`resforge.gui.ResForgeFrame`)
Open / drag-drop / **Fetch from server…** (remembers successful paths; offers them
as substring-matched, click-to-use suggestions below the input) / **Open from game
cache…** (Ctrl+O; scans the local Haven cache at `%APPDATA%\Haven and Hearth\data`,
opening immediately with a "scanning…" state then filling in a filterable list — `dyn/`
account-attached resources sort last and are greyed — and fetches the chosen one *fresh
from the server*, so the cache supplies names only and you always open the latest
version); layer table with **thumbnails** for
image/tex; per-layer editors: image/tex **preview**+**metadata** (id, z/sub-z,
offset — **editable** for old-style image headers)+replace+export (and a tex layer's
**alpha mask** gets its own preview+replace+export), **Ogg player**
(play/stop/draggable seek), **live animation playback** (anim frames resolved to
sibling image layers, composited at their true relative size + per-frame offset),
tooltip/pagina **text**, props/action/**mat2**/**anim**/**neg**/**obst**/**boneoff**/**light**
**JSON** (lossless-or-raw), `code`/`codeentry` **read-only** view (+ `.class`
export), **dependency/reference view** for `deps`/`rlink`/`src` (read-only;
`src` exports as `.java`), **rig view** for `skel`/`skan`/`manim`
(read-only structural display), font/midi replace+export, raw replace+export, a
built-in **3D viewer** (whole-model, software-rendered — see below; with a
**per-material texture picker** to swap each part's local `tex`, e.g. seasonal
leaves), 3D →
**Export/Rebuild glTF**. Layer
ops: **Add / Delete / Move up·down** (layer type/name is read-only).
Toolbar (two rows, with separators): row 1 **Open File · Fetch from Server · Open from
Cache (AppData)**; row 2 **View 3D · Export to glTF · Rebuild from glTF · References…**; the
**resource-version spinner** (uint16) sits on the file-path bar below. Menu accelerators:
Open Ctrl+L, Fetch Ctrl+R, **Open from game cache Ctrl+O**, Save As Ctrl+S.
**Edit → Undo/Redo** (Ctrl+Z/Y, snapshot-based). Full **file-path bar** under the toolbar.

## 5. Architecture (packages under `src/main/java/resforge/`)
- `Main` — CLI dispatch + GUI launch.
- `io/` — `MessageReader`/`MessageWriter` (LE primitives mirroring `haven.Message`,
  incl. `float16` half-precision ↔ float, `cpfloat` custom-packed float, and
  `mnorm16`/`snorm16`/`unorm16`/`oct2uvec` norm helpers), `Json` (dependency-free JSON),
  `SafeFiles` (atomic write: temp file + `Files.move(ATOMIC_MOVE)` so a crash/full-disk
  mid-save can't truncate the original — used by every CLI/GUI `.res`/`.glb` write).
  `MessageReader` is hardened against hostile input: overflow-safe bounds
  (`n<0 || n>end-pos`), strict-UTF-8 `string()` (rejects malformed bytes instead of
  substituting U+FFFD, so decode→encode stays byte-exact). `Json` rejects truncated
  `\u`/dangling escapes, duplicate object keys, non-RFC numbers, unescaped control
  characters, non-finite output, and unpaired Unicode surrogates.
- `res/` — `ResContainer` (parse/serialize the container; rejects implausible layer
  lengths — negative or > remaining bytes — so a crafted file can't trigger an OOM),
  `Layer` (name+bytes, immutable), `Manifest` (manifest.txt + per-layer codec; layer
  names/codecs are backslash-escaped so a name containing a tab/newline still
  round-trips, and `res-version` is range-checked to uint16), `Unpacker`/`Packer`
  (the "parts" model; codecs `raw|tex|props|action|anim|neg|obst|boneoff|light|mat2`;
  `Packer` rejects unknown codec names and part paths that escape the unpack dir —
  no `../`/absolute traversal), `Replacer`
  (one-shot swap), `Verifier` (batch round-trip + histograms), `Catalog` (folder
  listing), `References` (aggregate the external resources a `.res` references).
- `vbuf/` — `Vbuf2Format` (shared fixed attribute element counts) and
  `Vbuf2Codec` (structure-preserving vbuf2 encode with general per-attribute
  `decodeAttr`/`setAttr` re-quantisation). This neutral package is shared by
  `res` verification and `model` editing without creating a package cycle.
- `layers/` — read/locate decoders: `ImageInfo`, `TexInfo`, `AudioInfo`, `FontInfo`,
  `ImageMagic`, `Vbuf2Info`, `MeshInfo`, `TtoSkip`, `CodeInfo`, `CodeEntryInfo`,
  `DepsInfo`, `RLinkInfo`, `SrcInfo`, `LightInfo`, `SkelInfo`, `SkanInfo`,
  `BoneOffInfo`, `MeshAnimInfo`, `TileInfo` (terrain-tile header + image),
  `TilesetInfo`/`FlavObjInfo` (tileset tiler/tags/flavors + flavor-object refs) (read-only);
  typed JSON codecs `PropsCodec`,
  `ActionCodec`, `Mat2Codec`,
  `AnimCodec`,   `NegCodec`, `ObstCodec`, `BoneOffCodec`, `LightCodec` (tto/record ↔ JSON, lossless-or-raw); header-field
  codecs `ImageHeaderCodec` (id/z/subz/offset/nooff + build new image layers),
  `TexHeaderCodec` (id/offset/size), `TexMaskCodec` (extract/replace a tex layer's
  alpha mask — part tag 4 — recomputing its int32 length, format-checked),
  `AudioHeaderCodec` (clip id + volume) — all
  lossless-or-raw, image/audio bytes kept verbatim. The typed JSON codecs share a
  `Nums` helper that range-checks integer fields/counts on encode, so an out-of-range
  *edit* (e.g. `anim` `delay:70000`) fails loudly instead of silently wrapping on the
  wire. `ImageInfo` locates the embedded image by parsing the header **exactly** (the
  new-style tto block via `TtoSkip`) — no magic-byte scanning, so a stray "BM"/JPEG
  byte pair in a header can't be mistaken for the image and corrupt a replace/export.
- `model/` — `Vbuf2Data` (de-quantise vertices + decode bone weights for export),
  `ModelGeometry` (assemble a triangle soup — positions+normals+**UVs**, Haven Z-up,
  with a per-triangle **material index** + the full local-texture **palette** and each
  textured material's default texture + a `localBase` flag (local `tex` base vs
  non-local: external-static/varmat/`otex`-overlay) — from `vbuf2`+`mesh` for the in-app 3D viewer;
  reuses the same decoders as the glTF export), `LocalTextures` (resolve the
  `matid → mat2 → local tex` chain to raw image bytes, mirroring the export; the
  `tex`/`otex` command's index is the **tex layer's id** — `flayer(TexR.class, id)` —
  not its position; `isLocalBaseTex(matid)` distinguishes a local base `tex` from a
  non-local one (external-static `mlink`/external string, runtime varmat, or `otex`-overlay
  only)), `ExternalTextures` (resolve an *external static* base — an `mlink`/external
  `tex` string → one fixed resource — by fetching that resource via an injectable
  `Fetcher` and following its own `matid→mat2→tex` chain; per-path cache, depth cap +
  cycle guard; offline/no-fetcher resolves nothing. `ModelGeometry.from(res, fetcher)`
  appends the resolved images to the palette so the viewer's "Resolve external textures"
  toggle can texture those parts; `hasExternalStatic(res)` is an offline (no-fetch) check
  the viewer uses to show that toggle only when a model has such materials; runtime
  varmat / `Dyntex` stay shaded),
  `M4` (column-major 4×4 maths), `GltfExport` (geometry → Blender-ready binary
  glTF `.glb`, with both UV sets,
  embedded textures **and skinning** — skel→skin, bone weights→`JOINTS_0`/
  `WEIGHTS_0` — dependency-free),
  `GltfImport.rebuild` (regenerate `vbuf2`+`mesh`(+`bones2`/`bones`/`manim`) from an
  edited `.glb` at a new vertex count → re-quantises pos/nrm/both UVs into their original
  on-wire formats, Y-up→Z-up, rebuilds skinning weights via
  `Vbuf2Codec.setBones2` and morph shapes via `MeshAnimInfo.encodeWith`, recomputes
  tangents and re-poses the `skel` skeleton, keeping all other layers; allows
  reshaped/added/removed geometry, not byte-lossless). Rebuild **bakes un-applied
  glTF node transforms** (a Blender object moved/scaled/rotated without "Apply
  Transform") into positions, normals via the inverse-transpose, and morph deltas
  via rotation/scale without translation instead of dropping them; **renormalizes**
  skin weights after dropping joints that don't map;
  and **validates** its glТF input (GLB/JSON/BIN chunk bounds, accessor in-range,
  triangle-mode + index range, `setAttr` length, and **non-finite vertex values** —
  a NaN/Inf coordinate is rejected because it would otherwise poison a quantised
  attribute's shared max factor and decode every vertex back to NaN) so a malformed
  `.glb` fails cleanly rather than corrupting a layer.
- `audio/` — `OggVorbis` (Ogg → PCM via JOrbis).
- `net/` — `ResourceFetcher` (`<base>/<path>.res` GET, one shared lazily-created JDK
  HttpClient — holder idiom, so the pure `urlFor`/`baseName` helpers start no threads;
  resource names are strict UTF-8 URI path segments (spaces/non-ASCII encoded;
  query/fragment/percent/control/dot-segment ambiguity rejected);
  response bodies cap at 64 MiB via a bounded streaming subscriber, rejecting an
  excessive `Content-Length` before allocation and cancelling chunked/unknown-length
  responses at the same boundary),
  `CacheIndex`
  (reads the local Haven `HashDirCache` at `%APPDATA%\Haven and Hearth\data`: each
  `%016x.%d` file's header is `byte(1)`+`writeUTF(cid)`+`writeUTF(name)`, decoded with
  `DataInputStream.readUTF`; `res/`-prefixed names are the fetchable resource paths —
  scanned in parallel, sorted/deduped — so the GUI/CLI can list what the player has and
  re-fetch it fresh. Implemented from the client format; no third-party code).
- `gui/` — `ResForgeFrame` (the window: layer table, toolbar/menus, undo/redo,
  file/fetch/save orchestration + background threading), `LayerEditors` (builds the
  right-hand per-layer detail/editor panel, one `build*Panel` per kind; calls back
  through the small `EditorHost` interface so it owns no document/dialog/threading
  state), `FetchDialog` / `CachePickerDialog` (the "Fetch from server" and "Open from
  game cache" modal dialogs, extracted as self-contained pickers that return the chosen
  path+base — the frame still does the actual fetch via `fetchFromServer`),
  `WinFileDialogs` (Windows-only JNA helper that shows the modern Explorer file
  open/save dialog with the address bar via COM `IFileOpenDialog`/`IFileSaveDialog`;
  `ResForgeFrame` prefers it and falls back to `FileDialog` off-Windows or on failure),
  `GuiSupport` (per-layer preview/text/export, reuses
  decoders), `PreviewBudget` (encoded-byte + metadata-first bounded image decode and
  aggregate animation/palette/render limits), `ImageView`, `AudioPlayerPanel`, `AnimView`
  (offset-aware sprite playback; sibling images are indexed once and unique requested
  frames decode on a generation-gated daemon worker),
  `FetchHistory` (remembered fetch-path suggestions — pure logic, unit-tested),
  `ThumbnailCache` + `ThumbnailLoader` (EDT-confined 256-entry LRU for image/texture
  table thumbnails; generation-gated worker decode coalesces pending layers, and
  obsolete layer keys are removed on replace/delete and pruned on undo/redo),
  `Model3DView` (the **View 3D** software renderer: a hand-written z-buffered triangle
  rasteriser into a `BufferedImage`, two-sided Lambert head-light shading,
  **perspective-correct texture mapping and reciprocal z-buffer depth** (local textures,
  alpha-mask cutout) + optional
  wireframe, mouse orbit/zoom/pan; no native libs/OpenGL, fed by `model/ModelGeometry`
  + `model/LocalTextures`. Carries the full local-texture **palette** + a per-material
  default + a `localBase` flag; `setMaterialTexture(matIndex, paletteOrd)` re-points a
  material, and the dialog shows one combo only per **locally-textured** material
  (non-local bases — external-static `mlink`/varmat/`otex`-only — get none) — split over **two
  balanced rows** (testable `ResForgeFrame.buildTexturePickerRows`) so many-material
  models stay compact; so a model's alternate `tex` layers, e.g. mulberry's seasonal
  leaves, can be selected live, while knarr shows one picker not ten). Texture/mask
  palettes decode on the model workers; each view rasterises immutable render-state
  snapshots on its own coalescing daemon worker, while Swing paint only scales the
  latest cached frame. Triangle, internal-framebuffer, and cumulative raster-work
  budgets bound that work; generation/disposal cancellation is checked inside the
  raster loops, and budget failures become visible preview errors instead of partial
  frames. Closing/replacing a view invalidates late renders and external-resolution callbacks.
  Heavy work (open/parse, glTF export, glTF rebuild, 3D-geometry build) runs on a
  background thread and marshals the result back via `invokeLater`, so large files
  don't freeze the EDT. Document-replacing open/fetch/rebuild workers capture one
  shared operation generation plus the active document identity/revision; a completion
  is discarded if a newer operation, document load, edit, undo, or redo made its
  snapshot stale. glTF rebuild additionally uses an application-modal indeterminate
  progress dialog, so the user cannot start a conflicting document action while it
  runs. The Ogg player generation-gates decode/playback callbacks and atomically owns
  one `SourceDataLine`; pause, stop, selection changes and frame disposal invalidate
  stale work and close the active line.

## 6. Per-layer status
| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `image` | edit: swap embedded PNG/JPEG; **edit header** (id/z/sub-z/offset/nooff) for old-style; new image layers get a wrapped header |
| `tex` | edit: swap 3D texture + **alpha mask** (`tex`/`TexMaskCodec` recompute the int32 length); **edit header** (id/offset/declared size) |
| `audio2` | edit: swap Ogg; **edit clip id + volume** (ver-2 header); GUI plays it |
| `font` | edit: swap TTF/OTF (sfnt). 2-byte header + font tail |
| `midi` | edit: swap `.mid` (whole payload) |
| `props` | edit as JSON (tagged `tto` values: str/int/float/color/coord/bytes/…, lossless-or-raw) |
| `action` | edit as JSON (deterministic AButton record) |
| `mat2` | edit as JSON (id + per-command tto value lists; tagged-value form, lossless-or-raw) |
| `anim` | edit as JSON (sprite animation: id + delay + frame image-ids; deterministic) |
| `neg` | edit as JSON (click hotspot + bounds + endpoint groups; all int16, lossless) |
| `obst` | edit as JSON (collision polygons; float16 coords, lossless-or-raw) |
| `boneoff` | edit as JSON (equip-point opcode program: translate/rotate/eqpoint/bonealign/scale; cpfloat exact, quantised rotation axis kept as raw octahedral ints and angle range-checked, lossless-or-raw) |
| `light` | edit as JSON (light source: id, ambient/diffuse/specular colours 0..1, optional attenuation/direction/exponent; cpfloat ver0 / float32 ver1, lossless-or-raw) |
| `tooltip`/`pagina` | edit as strict UTF-8 text only when decode→encode preserves the original bytes; malformed payloads stay raw |
| `vbuf2`/`mesh` | **editable via glTF round-trip**: decoded; GUI shows vertex/attribute + tri/vbuf/material detail; Export/Rebuild glTF |
| `code`/`codeentry` | **read-only**: class name + `.class` export; entrypoint→class + classpath manifest shown |
| `deps`/`rlink`/`src` | **read-only reference view**: explicit dependency list (`deps`: name@ver), resource links + decoded specs (`rlink`), embedded source files (`src`, `.java` export) |
| `skel`/`skan` | layer view is **read-only**: bone hierarchy (`skel`) and skeletal animation tracks/events (`skan`); glTF rebuild can re-pose `skel`, but does not import edited `skan` keyframes |
| `manim` | layer view is **read-only**; glTF rebuild can replace each frame's morph shape when the original frame count is preserved, but does not add/remove/retime frames |
| `tile` | edit: swap the terrain tile image (PNG/JPEG; runs to EOM like `image`); shows kind (ground/border/centre-transition), id, weight |
| `tileset2`/`flavobj` | **read-only**: tileset tiler name + tags + flavor objects (`tileset2`); the sprite/sound a flavor spawns (`flavobj`) — both feed the `refs` report |
| everything else (`clamb`,`foodev`,`overlay`,`slink`,`plparts`,`rdesc`,…) | **raw passthrough** (lossless) |

## 7. Key format facts (see DESIGN-notes §2–8 for detail)
- Container: `"Haven Resource 1"`(16) + `uint16` ver + repeated [NUL-string name,
  `int32` len, bytes]. All LE. Unknown layers pass through.
- `vbuf2`: `uint8 fl`(ver=fl&0xf), `int16 id`(ver≥1), `uint16 num`, then per attr
  a name + (ver≥1: `int32`-len blob | ver0: inline). Bare names = `float32`×eln;
  `…2` names = `uint8(1)`+fmt+data (fmt ∈ f4/f2/f1/snN/unN/rnN/sf9995/uvecN).
  Bones (`bones`/`bones2`) = per-bone RLE weight spans. mkres defaults: pos→sn2,
  nrm/tan/bit→uvec1, tex/otex→un2|sn2.
- `mesh`: `uint8 fl`; old form (`fl&0x80`==0) num/matid/…/indices; indices raw
  `uint16×3` or **delta-stripped** (`unstrip`/`decdelta`).
- Server fetch: `<base>/<path>.res`, base default
  `http://game.havenandhearth.com/res/` (the official server; same as the client);
  each resource-name segment is URI-encoded rather than concatenated raw.
- From CarryGun's tool (knowledge only, no code taken): `neg`'s 12 "skipped" bytes
  are tl/br/oc offsets (coord16); `mat2` = id + map of key→tto-value-list.

## 8. Reference & samples
- `docs/reference/`: verbatim client sources `Resource.java`, `Message.java`,
  `NormNumber.java`, `TexR.java`, `VertexBuf.java`, `Skeleton.java`, `Light.java`,
  `MeshAnim.java`, and the dev's `mkres-fragment.py` (Ogre-XML→binary encoder).
  LGPL — keep notices. (Full client also at `..\hafen-client` as the format oracle.)
- `samples/` (gitignored, copyrighted game assets): real `.res` + raw png/wav.
  `verify samples` → **all pass** (a mislabeled non-resource — zero bytes + a raw
  PNG — was removed; the tool correctly rejects such files). Histograms confirm all
  image/tex/audio/font/props/action/**mat2**/**anim**/**neg** decode/round-trip
  exactly, all `vbuf2` re-encode byte-exact, all `mesh` decode, and all
  `code`/`codeentry`/`deps`/`src`/`rlink`/`light`/`skel`/`skan`/`boneoff`/`manim`
  decode. **Every layer type present in the samples is now decoded** (no raw
  unknowns left). (Counts grow as more samples are added; `verify` is the live
  oracle — keep it all-pass.)

## 9. Conventions
- Lossless-or-raw: never expose a typed editor unless decode→encode is byte-exact
  (verified). Untouched layers always pass through unchanged.
- **Hostile-input safe**: the parser is hardened to fail cleanly (clear exception),
  never OOM/hang/corrupt, on a crafted or truncated `.res` — overflow-safe reader
  bounds, length validation, strict UTF-8, no magic-scanning, and recursion-depth
  caps (`Json` object/array nesting plus `PropsCodec`, `TtoSkip`, `RLinkInfo`,
  `CodeEntryInfo`, and `Mat2Codec` tto list/map nesting cap at 256), so a deeply
  nested document fails through normal malformed-input handling rather than a
  `StackOverflowError` that would escape `catch(RuntimeException)` guards.
  Network-fetched resource bodies are capped at 64 MiB for both declared and
  unknown/chunked lengths.
  Typed-codec *edits*
  are range-checked (`Nums`) so a bad value is rejected, not silently wrapped.
- **Atomic writes**: all `.res`/`.glb` output and final unpack `manifest.txt`
  publication goes through `io/SafeFiles` (temp + atomic rename), so interruption
  never leaves the original/only copy or manifest truncated.
- **Background results are revision-gated**: any worker that can replace the active
  document must capture `DocumentRevision.Token` and complete it before changing GUI
  state. Every content edit and undo/redo advances the revision; every load advances
  document identity.
- `Layer` is immutable; edits *replace* it (enables cheap snapshot undo).
- Edits route through `Replacer` where possible (tested, format-checked).
- Commit per feature. Every AI-assisted commit must credit the assistant used:
  include the `Co-authored-by: Copilot …` trailer and a `Powered by <model/tool>`
  paragraph naming the actual AI model or tool. Keep all three builds green
  (Gradle/Maven/Ant); verify on real `samples/` before claiming done.
- **Keep docs in lockstep with code.** Every add/change updates the relevant docs in
  the *same* commit: this primer for architecture/features/current work,
  `DESIGN-notes.md` for detailed design and reverse-engineering history, `README.md`
  and the per-layer table for user-visible behavior, and `kb/notes/` for durable
  format findings and decisions. A change isn't done until its docs match.

## 10. Open / deferred work
Completed feature history belongs in `CHANGELOG.md` and `DESIGN-notes.md`; this
section lists only current limitations or intentionally deferred work.

- **Animation editing:** `skan` keyframes are exported to glTF but edits are not
  imported. `manim` morph shapes are rebuilt, but the original frame count and
  timing are retained and Blender's shape-key animation is not read. Adding,
  removing, or retiming `skan`/`manim` frames needs a dedicated write path.
- **Typed coverage:** unusual `mat2`/`props` values using float8/float16 or
  snorm/unorm/mnorm still stay raw until exact decode→encode behavior is proven.
  The new-style typed (`tto`) `image` header parser is implemented exactly but
  remains unverified on a real sample; none occurred among 669 images in the
  recorded corpus, so validation is opportunistic if one is found.
- **3D viewer follow-ons:** the viewport still has no skeletal/morph playback,
  and it does not composite a local `otex` overlay over a fetched external base.
  Runtime-selected varmat textures and `Dyntex` sprite additions remain out of
  scope because their final pixels are not stored in the model resource.
- **Test fixture gap:** `OggVorbis.decode` still lacks a redistributable Vorbis
  fixture. Copyrighted game assets remain local-only and must not be committed.
- GUI niceties are otherwise considered complete. Folder-wide re-skinning and
  layer search/filter were explicitly declined; use CLI `catalog` + `replace`
  for scripted batch work.

## 11. The other tool (context)
CarryGun's **HafenResourceTool** (GitLab, Qt/C++): broader typed coverage +
working OBJ/Ogre-XML import/export and per-type editors, but **re-encodes typed
layers** (round-trip fidelity depends on each encoder; mitigated by an edited
flag) — less lossless-safe than our parts model. Useful as a format reference.
